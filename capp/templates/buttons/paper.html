    <h1>Full Methodology Paper</h1>

    <p>
        The global challenge of climate change requires urgent and comprehensive action across all sectors.
        The transport sector in particular is a critical area in Europe where significant emissions
        reductions must be achieved. Current data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) show that 
        the transport sector was responsible for 32% of total emissions in Europe in 2023 (IEA, 2025).
    </p>

    <p>
        At the same time, public awareness and concern about climate change is steadily increasing
        (Schwerdtle et al., 2023). However, this rising awareness often contrasts with the limited pace of 
        climate policy implementation at national level (Reuters, 2025). This gap opens the opportunity 
        for innovative, citizen-centred solutions.

        In this context, this paper presents the methodology and business plan for a new carbon footprint app.
        The app is designed as a practical tool that collects real mobility data and makes individual impact 
        transparent without relying on complex systems or unrealistic assumptions. Rather than focusing only 
        on individual users, the app also targets companies, encouraging them to integrate mobility-based 
        emissions tracking into their sustainability strategies.

        As a group of five students from Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany, we bring together different 
        perspectives, habits, and cultural approaches. These differences became a strength, helping us look 
        at the same problem from multiple angles and develop solutions that are practical, adaptable, and 
        inclusive. Working together highlighted how everyday behaviours differ from one country to another, 
        and how small habits can influence emissions. This diversity shaped our vision of an app that connects 
        people and data across environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The structure of this paper is as follows:  
        First, we explain the purpose of the app.  
        Second, we describe the methodology behind the calculations, including the algorithms and data sources.  
        Finally, we present the business plan, covering market strategy, revenue model, and scalability.
